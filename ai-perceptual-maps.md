title: "Can AI make a perceptual map for..."
permalink: /ai-perceptual-maps

One of my favorite classes I've taken as part of my Kellogg MBA journey has been Marketing Research and Analytics. In class, we learned the power of the positioning map as a tool to visualize how effective companies and products differentiate themselves from the competition in the eyes of the consumer.
Excitingly, I learned that how you get that data can be revolutionized by AI. Using this study (which seeks to replicate the results of this one), I learned that we can get pretty close to actual survey data simply by polling a GPT and aggregating the data using the data language, R.
Using my Perplexity AI pro subscription (thanks to Divs Singh for getting Kellogg students the free year!)
